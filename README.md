## This project has officially been deprecated.

Due to the fact that I am unable to constantly keep up with Windows' ever-growing set of self-protection and monitoring tools, I decided to abandon the project. There is a much better and reliable post-install toolkit I'd recommend - [tronscript](https://old.reddit.com/r/TronScript/)

# Windows Configuration

This is a small set of scripts which allow for downloading a set of packages. It's mainly desgined for personal use, but this does not mean it cannot be modified for wide-spread use.

## Requirements

These only require Windows 10.

## Getting Started

Since you won't be able to use git during the starting procedure, I recommend downloading the repo over HTTPS.
You should copy it to your home directory (removing the -master sufix).

Then, just fire up an administrative powershell and:

```powershell
cd ~
cd WinConf
./install.ps1
```

## Built With

* [Autohotkey](https://autohotkey.com) - Allows for powerful windows scripting.
* [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) - The Windows Package Manager
